# 🌶 pepper

Pepper is a web tool for organizing and browsing past revisions of your music projects to see how they have evolved. Think self-hosted Soundcloud with time travel.

## Why this exists

Starting in 2014, I began to use Splice Studio as version control and backup for my own music projects. One of its notable features was the ability to attach an audio render to each revision, which allowed you to listen to how that exact revision sounded.

In 2023, Splice announced they were [shutting down Studio](https://splice.com/blog/studio-shutdown). While there are many possible alternatives for version control, I wasn't able to find a suitable replacement for organizing and browsing the many audio renders of each song. So, I hacked together Pepper.

# ðŸŒ¶ pepper

Pepper is a simple web tool for listening to different revisions of music projects as they evolve.

I created this in response to Splice Studio shutting down. Since Pepper does not perform any actual version control, it cannot replace Splice Studio, but it does allow me to listen to old versions of my songs.
